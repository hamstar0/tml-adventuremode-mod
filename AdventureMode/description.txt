Welcome to Adventure Mode! This is a game mode built around journeying and exploration, but also accomplishing goals. This is designed to create a new experience upon existing content, but with a few twists. There's a lot of new features and changes from the base game. Here's a few important ones to note:
- Building and digging disabled (some exceptions).
- Use house kits to create NPC houses, beds, crafting stations, and fast travel points.
- All crafting is now handled at workbenches.
- Use platforms, planks, ropes, and rails kits to get around.
- Use Orbs (found in chests) to open new areas.
- Ammo is more expensive; use wisely.
- Talk to the Guide for further help.
