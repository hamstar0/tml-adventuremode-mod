-	@Staff of Gaia
	-	Add Staff of Aether
		-	@Plan
			-	Naturally generated in floating island chests
			-	Grants unlimited flight for up to 30s, but consumes nearby 'world power' to do so
			-	Additional flight is possible, but at the cost of additional 'world power' (via. r-click)
			-	'World power' now only exists where there's solid terrain (still non-renewable)
			-	While flight active, staff also works as a weapon able to 12 damage, ignoring element resists

-	Allow ducking inside a minecart to avoid damage (but risk derailing; no attacks possible, also)
-	Underworld
	-	@Plan: Protective items
		-	Jester's Motley (via Jungle) - Wards Tricksters (especially nasty in the underworld)
		-	Vegetative Vestment (via Underground Desert) - Protects against underworld heat
		-	Mana Circuits (via Dungeon) - Retains mana (underworld drains mana)
	-	Set Tricksters to slowly regenerate hp and attack slightly quicker
