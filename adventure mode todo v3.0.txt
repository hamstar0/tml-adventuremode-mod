Ideas:
-	@Add Throwable Melee Weapons mod
-	Set each new boss kill to drop 3 Teleporation Potions
-	@Staff of Gaia
	-	Add Staff of Aether
		-	@Plan
			-	Naturally generated in floating island chests
			-	Grants unlimited flight for up to 30s, but consumes nearby 'world power' to do so
			-	Additional flight is possible, but at the cost of additional 'world power' (via. r-click)
			-	'World power' now only exists where there's solid terrain (still non-renewable)
			-	While flight active, staff also works as a weapon able to 12 damage, ignoring element resists
-	Add Caving Harness accessory (start item; auto-deploys a rope to allow quickly returning to the surface)
-	Allow ducking inside a minecart to avoid damage (but risk derailing; no attacks possible, also)
-	Underworld
	-	@Plan: Protective items
		-	Jester's Motley (via Jungle) - Wards Tricksters (especially nasty in the underworld)
		-	Vegetative Vestment (via Underground Desert) - Protects against underworld heat
		-	Mana Circuits (via Dungeon) - Retains mana (underworld drains mana)
	-	Set Tricksters to slowly regenerate hp and attack slightly quicker
	-	Add underworld debuff: Heat Prostration (similar to old Necrotis)
-	@Trickster
	-	Add surface tricks (item stealing + racing?)
-	@Mounted Magic Mirrors
	-	Allow labeling mirrors on the map (and recoloring?)
-	@Add Elements mod (with elemental gates)
-	@Add Trusty Steed mod
-	Blast Mining
	-	@Add Cave Ins mod
	-	Set Bomb and Dynamite explosions to destroy tiles with no more than 1 cardinal neighbor (mention in tooltip)
-	@Add Myconids Attack! mod
-	@Terrain Remixer
	-	Add 'middle earth' setting



[v3]
-	Remake trailer
-	@Add Adventure Mode Lore mod (for now, only intro cutscene)
